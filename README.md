### What I learned

Creating a solution to the REST Countries API with color theme switcher taught me a lot about modern web development technologies. 

Using React, React Router, and Styled Components allowed me to build a responsive and dynamic user interface that can handle complex user interactions. 

Additionally, working with APIs using Axios helped me understand how to fetch data and integrate it into my application. 

The color theme switcher feature was a great exercise in using CSS custom properties to create a seamless user experience. 

Overall, this project gave me practical experience in using cutting-edge web development tools to build a functional and engaging application.
